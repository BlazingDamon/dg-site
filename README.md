This repository contains a .NET API, an Angular application, and a few scripts to boot up a MongoDB instance locally.

This is the code for a full-stack disc golf statistics tracking application. It is a proof of concept for a variety of different technologies and patterns, and is incomplete.

The .NET API is the most functional component. The Angular application is hardly more than an `ng new` with a few lines of custom code on top, and it is not yet wired up to the API.

The API and MongoDB components require an active Docker installation.
