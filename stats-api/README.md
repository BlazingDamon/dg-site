Prior to booting this API, ensure you have an instance of MongoDB running locally as detailed in the `/stats-infrastructure` directory.

Once your MongoDB instance is up and running, set the `Statistics.API` project as your startup project and launch the `Statistics.API` profile to get started.

The API integration tests require Docker to be running locally, but otherwise are set up and ready to be run through Visual Studio.
